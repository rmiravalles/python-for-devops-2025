# Compiled languages vs. Interpreted languages

## Compiled languages

Compiled languages are programming languages that are translated into machine code (binary code) before execution. This means that the entire program is converted into a format that the computer's processor can understand and execute directly. The compilation process typically involves several steps, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

The resulting machine code is usually stored in an executable file, which can be run on the target machine without the need for the original source code or a compiler.

Compiled languages are generally faster than interpreted languages because the code is executed directly by the machine's processor, without the overhead of an interpreter. However, they may require a longer development time due to the compilation step and the need to recompile the code after making changes.

Examples of compiled languages include:
- C
- C++
- Rust
- Go
- Swift

## Interpreted languages

Interpreted languages are programming languages that are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. Instead of being compiled into machine code before execution, the source code is read and executed directly by the interpreter. This allows for more flexibility and ease of debugging, as developers can test and modify their code without the need for a separate compilation step.

Interpreted languages are generally slower than compiled languages because the interpreter must read and execute the code line by line, which adds overhead. However, they often provide more dynamic features, such as dynamic typing and runtime evaluation, which can make development faster and easier.

Examples of interpreted languages include:
- Python
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Perl
